                <p> 
                    If I told you that I loved you <br>
                    Tell me, what would you say? <br>
                    If I told you that I hated you <br>
                    Would you go away? <br>
                    Now I need your help with everything that I do <br>
                    I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you <br>
                    Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
                    I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up <br>

                I'm sick and I'm tired too <br>
                I can admit, I am not fireproof <br>
                I feel it burning me <br>
                I feel it burning you <br>
                I hope I don't murder me <br>
                I hope I don't burden you <br>
                If I do, I do <br>

        <h2> Terceira parte </h2>
        <p>
            If I meet you in the middle maybe we could agree <br>
            You make me feel little how you're looking at me <br>
            And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off <br>
            First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on <br>
            Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
            I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up <br>

            I feel it burning you <br>
            I hope I don't murder me <br>
            I hope I don't burden you <br>
        </p>
        <h2> Quinta parte </h2>

            Swim with me <br>
            I think I could see the beach <br>
            I know what's underneath  <br>
            I need you here with me<br>
            But we're out in the open<br>
            Swim with me<br>
            I think I could see the beach<br>
            Just don't look underneath us<br>
