                <p> 
                    If I told you that I loved you <br>
                    Tell me, what would you say? <br>
                    If I told you that I hated you <br>
                    Would you go away? <br>
                    Now I need your help with everything that I do <br>
                    I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you <br>
                    Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
                    I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm sick and I'm tired too <br>
                    I can admit, I am not fireproof <br>
                    I feel it burning me <br>
                    I feel it burning you <br>
                    I hope I don't murder me <br>
                    I hope I don't burden you <br>
                    If I do, I do <br>

                <h2> Terceira parte </h2>
                <p>
                    If I meet you in the middle maybe we could agree <br>
                    You make me feel little how you're looking at me <br>
                    And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off <br>
                    First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on <br>
                    Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
                    I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up <br>
